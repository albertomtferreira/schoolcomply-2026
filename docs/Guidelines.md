## 8. Monetisation Philosophy

Current decision: monetisation planning is deferred until pilot validation is complete.

### Now

- Pilot internally
- Validate value and usability
- Build trust through reliable outcomes

### Later

- Introduce pricing after clear evidence of adoption and operational value
- Keep a lean pricing model and simple commercial structure

Focus:
Structure first. Revenue second. Scalability after validation.

---

## 9. Long-Term Brand Goal

Become the quiet infrastructure layer that school leaders rely on daily.

Not flashy.
Not noisy.
Just indispensable.
