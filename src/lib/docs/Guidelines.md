## 2. Mission & Vision

### Mission

To give schools a simple, visual, real-time understanding of their compliance status — before issues become risks.

### Vision

To become the lightweight but powerful compliance layer for schools across the UK, starting with training and statutory monitoring and expanding into a full compliance suite.

## 3. Core Philosophy

You identified three foundational values:

* **Reliability** – Data must be accurate and trusted.
* **Simplicity** – No corporate bloat. No unnecessary complexity.
* **Visual** – Clear dashboards. Red/Amber/Green logic. Instant clarity.

This is not a “document storage tool”.
This is a **decision-support system for leaders**.

> **Atlas Note:** This distinction is critical. We do not just store files; we answer the question "Are we safe?".
